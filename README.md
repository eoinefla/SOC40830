SOC40830, Quantitative Data Analytics, Introductory Graduate

<b/>Brief Outline</b>

Quantitative analysis is one of a wide menu of approaches to social science research. This module
introduces you to the fundamentals of quantitative data analysis, with a particular emphasis on
application. Working with real-world data, and with few assumptions of prior knowledge, it will
equip you with a range of techniques to perform your own independent analyses, and design your
own theoretically-informed studies. The course will involve working with cross-sectional,
longitudinal, and geographical data, enabling you to study patterns of social change over space and
time, whilst gently exposing you to the practice of multivariate data analysis. You will also gain
good grounding in Stata.
